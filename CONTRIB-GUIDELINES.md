# Suckless Linux Contribution Guidelines

## During development: 

1. Create a new fork or branch of this project
2. Make your changes
3. Create a pull-request to the development branch (e.g. "vX.X.X"), containing the following information: 
	- A summary of the changes made
	- Tests being done and
	- The outcome of these tests

## During communication with others: 

Suckless Linux is free and open source, which means that it lives from community and contributions. 

A basic set of rules and guidelines should ensure that nobody feels harassed and bullied out of development of such a free and open source project: 

1. Keep politics out of this project
2. Keep personal issues and topics out of this project
3. Keep it professional

Not following these simple rules, especially if the behaviour would be unacceptable in a professional setting, could result in an exclusion of the project.
