# Suckless Linux
An Arch-based linux distribution, inspired by [suckless](https://suckless.org/philosophy/)
Suckless Linux is designed to be lightweight and fast, while still be a usable desktop operating system. 

## Why Suckless Linux?

Suckless Linux follows the Arch-Linux "KISS"- and the suckless-philosophy, the way we interpret it: 
- Suckless Linux ships with what you need, minus what you don't need
- Suckless Linux aims to be a "Distribution that sucks less", while still retaining user-friendliness
- Suckless Linux gives a stable base for an Arch Linux-based Installation, while still leaving everything else up to the User
