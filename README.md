# suckless-linux
My own [suckless](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) linux build

## Features

- *Who needs systemd?* This build uses BusyBox's own init process, for convenience and simplicity
- *No unneccessary bullsh_t!* This comes with a minimal toolset provided by BusyBox, as well as the Linux kernel itself
- *Package Managers are bloat?!* You want software? Go ahead, build it yourself. 
- *Completely Free and Open Source!* That's right, minimalistic build, minimalistic worries


## What Suckless-Linux ships with

- The linux kernel
- BusyBox
- Cross-Linux-from-Scratch buildscripts
- Zlib
